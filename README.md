## üìù Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This project focuses on sentiment analysis, a common NLP task that classifies text based on sentiment polarity (e.g., positive or negative).  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.
